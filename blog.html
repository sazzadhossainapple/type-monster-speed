                The Local storage capacity of local storage is 5MB/10MB. But the
                Session storage capacity of session storage is 5MB.
              </li>
              <li>
                Their main difference is that local storage data does not
                expire, whereas session storage data gets cleared when the user
                closes its browser window.
              </li>
              <li>
                In local and Session storage there is no transfer of data to the
                server.

              What is the difference between global scope and block scope?

                The variables defined outside of any function or curly brackets
                are known as global variables and have global scope. Global
                scope means that the variables can be accessed from any part of
                that program, and any function or conditional state can access
                that variable. But Block scope is also a sub-type of local
                scope. The block scope can be defined as the scope of the
                variables inside the curly brackets {}. Now, these curly
                brackets can be of loops, or conditional statements, or
                something else. You are only allowed to refer to these variables
                from within the curly brackets {}.

            <ul class="blog-text-content">
              <li>
                The Event Loop has one simple job to monitor the Call Stack and
                the Callback Queue. If the Call Stack is empty, the Event Loop
                will take the first event from the queue and will push it to the
                Call Stack, which effectively runs it. Such an iteration is
                called a tick in the Event Loop. Each event is just a function
                callback.
