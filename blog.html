                The Local storage capacity of local storage is 5MB/10MB. But the
                Session storage capacity of session storage is 5MB.
              </li>
              <li>
                Their main difference is that local storage data does not
                expire, whereas session storage data gets cleared when the user
                closes its browser window.
              </li>
              <li>
                In local and Session storage there is no transfer of data to the
                server.

                The variables defined outside of any function or curly brackets
                are known as global variables and have global scope. Global
                scope means that the variables can be accessed from any part of
                that program, and any function or conditional state can access
                that variable. But Block scope is also a sub-type of local
                scope. The block scope can be defined as the scope of the
                variables inside the curly brackets {}. Now, these curly
                brackets can be of loops, or conditional statements, or
                something else. You are only allowed to refer to these variables
                from within the curly brackets {}.

            <h2 class="blog-text-title">How javascript event loop works.</h2>
            <ul class="blog-text-content">
              <li>
                The Event Loop has one simple job to monitor the Call Stack and
                the Callback Queue. If the Call Stack is empty, the Event Loop
                will take the first event from the queue and will push it to the
                Call Stack, which effectively runs it. Such an iteration is
                called a tick in the Event Loop. Each event is just a function
                callback.
              </li>
              <li>
                An event loop is something that pulls stuff out of the queue and
                places it onto the function execution stack whenever the
                function stack becomes empty. The event loop is the secret by
                which JavaScript gives us an illusion of being multithreaded
                even though it is single-threaded. The callback function in the
                event queue has not yet run and is waiting for its time into the
                stack when the SetTimeOut() is being executed and the Web API is
                making the mentioned wait. When the function stack becomes
                empty, the function gets loaded onto it. That is where the event
                loop comes into, it takes the first event from the Event Queue
                and places it onto the stack i.e in this case the callback
                function. From here, this function executes calling other
                functions inside it, if any. This cycle is called the event loop
                and this is how JavaScript manages its events.

                The global undefined property represents the primitive value
                undefined. It is one of JavaScript's primitive types.
